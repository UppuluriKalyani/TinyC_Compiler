1.Token Definitions: Define the token names (e.g., identifiers, integers, operators) using a `tokens` class variable.

2. Regular Expressions: Use regular expressions to specify the patterns for each token. For example, `ID = r'[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*'` for identifiers.

3. Ignore Characters: Specify characters to be ignored, such as whitespace and tabs, using the `ignore` class variable.

4.Error Handling: Implement an error method (e.g., `error(t)`) to handle and report any unexpected characters or errors in the input.

5. Lexer Initialization: Create an instance of the lexer, and input the source code to be tokenized.

6. Tokenization: The lexer will tokenize the input source code into individual tokens based on the defined token patterns.

7.Output Tokens: Iterate through the tokens generated by the lexer and process them as needed (e.g., passing them to a parser for further analysis or printing them).



**-tokens**:

1.Debugging Aid: `-tokens` is a debugging option used with a lexer implemented using SLY.

2. Purpose: It's used to print the recognized tokens as the lexer processes the input source code.

3. Debugging Tool: Helps developers verify how the lexer identifies and tokenizes different parts of the source code.

4.Error Detection: Useful for identifying errors in lexer rules or token patterns by comparing expected tokens to the actual output.

5. Testing: Allows quick testing of the lexer against sample input code to ensure correct tokenization.

6.Usage Example: To use the `-tokens` option, configure your lexer, input the code, and iterate through the tokens, printing them out for inspection.
