1. **Install SLY**: Begin by installing the SLY library using `pip install sly`.



2. **Define Lexer**: Create a Lexer class that recognizes tokens like numbers (integers and floats) and defines error handling for unexpected characters.



3. **Define Parser**: Build a Parser class that defines parsing rules for arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and handles operator precedence. Also, include error handling for division by zero.



4. **Main Program Loop**: In the main program, repeatedly prompt the user for mathematical expressions, tokenize the input using the lexer, and parse and evaluate the expressions using the parser. Display the results to the user.



5.**Testing and Customization**: Test the calculator by inputting various mathematical expressions to ensure it performs calculations correctly. You can customize and extend the calculator's functionality to suit your needs, such as adding more mathematical functions or memory storage.
